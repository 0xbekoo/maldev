Welcome to the maldev repo. This repository contains projects I have prepared as part of my journey into malware development. As a beginner in this field, I will be continuously adding new projects to this repo as I learn and develop my skills.

The projects in this repository are organized into two categories: ASM and C/C++. Each section contains various malware development projects that focus on different techniques and concepts using these programming languages:

### ASM

## Compiling and running projects

Assuming that you have development tools like Visual Studio, I have not included executable files (e.g., .exe or .sys). You will need to compile the projects yourself using the provided source code.

### 1. ASM Projects

You need to make sure you have a Windows 10/11 x64 system, especially if you want to run Assembly programs. 

To run the assembly programs, you must have a Windows 10/11 x64 system. Follow these steps to turn the assembly projects into executable files:
- In Visual Studio, right-click on the project.
- Navigate to **Build Dependencies** -> **Build Customization** and enable **masm(.targets, .props)**.
- After enabling MASM, create a project in the solution with files that have `.asm` and `.inc` extensions.
- Copy the provided assembly code into these files.

### 2. C/C++ Projects

To work with the C/C++ projects, ensure you have Visual Studio or a compatible development environment set up. Follow these steps to build and run the projects:

- Create projects with .c and .h extensions and copy the code.
- Build the project by selecting the appropriate build configuration (e.g., Debug or Release) and compiling the code.
- After a successful build, you can run the resulting executable to test the project.
